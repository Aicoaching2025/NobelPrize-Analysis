## 📖 Project Overview

This project demonstrates comprehensive sentiment analysis methodologies applied to classic literature, specifically Jane Austen's novels and Charles Dickens' *Pride and Prejudice*.

### 🎯 Key Objectives

- 📊 Compare multiple sentiment analysis lexicons (AFINN, Bing, NRC)
- 🎨 Visualize emotional arcs throughout literary narratives
- 🧠 Implement context-aware sentiment scoring with valence shifters
- 👥 Analyze character-specific sentiment patterns
- 🔍 Track multi-dimensional emotions beyond positive/negative classification
